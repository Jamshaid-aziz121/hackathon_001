# AI / Spec-Driven Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Educational Clarity
Content must progress from beginner concepts to advanced implementations while remaining understandable to readers with a computer science background.

### Technical Accuracy
All AI, robotics, cloud-native, and agentic system content must be technically correct, current, and aligned with real-world systems.

### Practical Outcomes
The book must emphasize hands-on learning through runnable examples, simulations, and real implementation patterns.

### Ethical & Responsible AI
Safety, robustness, and responsible AI practices must be explicitly addressed, especially in physical and humanoid systems.

### Content Verification
All content must be original and source-traceable; all factual and technical claims must be verifiable; code examples must run successfully or be clearly marked as pseudocode.

### Technical Standards
All AI, robotics, and agentic system content must align with ROS2, use URDF where applicable, reflect current production practices, and clearly label experimental or speculative patterns.

## Standards and Requirements

Content standards: All content must be original and source-traceable, all factual and technical claims must be verifiable, code examples must run successfully or be clearly marked as pseudocode.

Robotics standards: Concepts must align with ROS2, URDF must be used where applicable, real-world control systems and simulation environments must be respected.

Agentic AI standards: Content must reflect current production practices, experimental or speculative patterns must be clearly labeled.

Citations standards: All content must come from official documentation, peer-reviewed research, or reputable technical publications; marketing material, unverifiable blogs, and unsourced claims are prohibited.

Tone standards: Content must follow a mentor-to-student style that is respectful, direct, and instructional.

Accessibility requirements: Images and figures must include descriptive alt text, diagrams must be labeled and technically accurate, Markdown must be fully compatible with Docusaurus, navigation must follow Docusaurus best practices.

## Development Structure

Chapter requirements: Each chapter must start from a clear specification, include learning objectives, concept explanation, practical examples, step-by-step implementation, and a final exercise or challenge.

Technical modules must include: Inputs, Outputs, System architecture, Code implementation, Failure modes, Safety considerations.

Verification requirements: All non-obvious claims must be cited, contradictory research findings must be acknowledged, claims must be grounded in authoritative sources.

Constraints: Word count must be between 20,000-35,000 words, at least one working demo (simulation acceptable) must be included, format must be Markdown (Docusaurus-compatible), deployment must work cleanly to GitHub Pages.

Success criteria: A student can build a working AI or robotics system by following the book, all examples are reproducible, all claims are verifiable, the Docusaurus build passes without errors, theory and practice are balanced, safety and limitations are clearly documented.

Priority order: Accuracy, Practicality, Clarity, Speed.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all informal practices. All contributions must be reviewed against this constitution. Authority: This constitution supersedes all informal practices. Amendments require written justification, approval record, and migration or update plan.
