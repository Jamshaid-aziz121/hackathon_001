# Educational Robotics Book Overview

## Mission

This book aims to provide a comprehensive guide to robotics and AI applications in educational environments. It combines theoretical foundations with practical implementation, enabling educators and students to understand and apply robotics concepts in real-world educational settings.

## Structure

The book is organized into four main modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Core concepts of Robot Operating System 2
- Communication patterns (publishers, subscribers, services)
- Robot modeling with URDF
- Practical examples and exercises

### Module 2: Simulation Environments
- Gazebo simulation for robotics testing
- Unity integration for educational scenarios
- Physics modeling and environment design
- Simulation-to-reality transfer concepts

### Module 3: AI Perception Systems
- NVIDIA Isaac tools for robot perception
- Vision-based navigation and SLAM
- Sensor fusion techniques
- AI-driven decision making

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Systems
- Voice command recognition and processing
- Vision-language-action (VLA) models
- Human-robot interaction design
- Educational application scenarios

## Educational Approach
